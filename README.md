## history of slot machines
The origins of slot machines can be traced back to the late 19th Century. The first slot machine was developed by the New York based company, Sittman and Pitt in 1891. The game had 5 drums with a total of 50 playing cards. The machine could be found in many bars, and cost a nickel to play.



## Getting Started
Minimalist-slots
https://minimalist-slots.netlify.app/
- A simple minimalist slot machine. Start out with 5000 credits, every spin costs 10 credits, but get three matching icons in a row, itll increase your credits! If you hit 0 credits, game over. The reason i chose this game is because its something i can keep continuing to work on. It helped me understand the foundations of HTML, CSS and JS, and i knew i would have a fun time building it!



## how to play and point system
-Hit spin!, every time you get three matching icons in a row itll add to your credits! if you hit 0 credits then you lose!
  
  - 3 cherries: 50
  - 3 bells: 50
  - 3 clovers: 125
  - 3 diamonds: 500
  - 3 sevens: 5000 (jackpot!)
  - Costs 10 per spin
